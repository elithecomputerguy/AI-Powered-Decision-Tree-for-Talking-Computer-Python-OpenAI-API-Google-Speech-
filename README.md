# Machine Learning with OpenAI and Relational Database (OpenAI, Python, SQLite)

This project caches requests made to OpenAI in a SQLite database so that future identical requests can be retrieved from the database without making an API call.   The script allows the user to ask in a more natural way information from the system. System functions include hello, goodbye, time, weather and to tell a joke.  OpenAI is used to determine which function the user is asking for.
